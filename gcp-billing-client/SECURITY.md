- Type of issue (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit it

### What to Expect

When you report a vulnerability, you can expect:

1. Confirmation of receipt within 48 hours
2. An initial assessment of the vulnerability within 5 business days
3. Regular updates about our progress
4. Credit in any public disclosure (if desired)

### Disclosure Policy

When we receive a security bug report, we will:

1. Confirm receipt of the vulnerability report within 48 hours
2. Verify the issue and determine its impact
3. Release a fix as soon as possible depending on complexity
4. Notify users when a fix is available

### Comments on this Policy

## Security Best Practices

When using this library, please follow these security best practices:

1. **Keep Dependencies Updated**
   - Regularly update to the latest version of the library
   - Monitor dependencies for security vulnerabilities
   - Use tools like `safety` or `dependabot` to automate security updates

2. **Credential Management**
   - Never hardcode credentials in your code
   - Use environment variables or secure credential management systems
   - Rotate credentials regularly
   - Use the principle of least privilege when setting up service accounts

3. **API Security**
   - Use HTTPS/TLS for all API communications
   - Implement proper rate limiting
   - Monitor and audit API usage
   - Validate all input data

4. **Error Handling**
   - Don't expose sensitive information in error messages
   - Implement proper logging without sensitive data
   - Handle errors gracefully without revealing system details

5. **Authentication**
   - Use strong authentication methods
   - Implement proper session management
   - Use multi-factor authentication where possible

## Code Security Requirements

When contributing to this project, ensure your code follows these security requirements:

1. **Input Validation**
   - Validate all input parameters
   - Sanitize data before processing
   - Use type hints and validation decorators

2. **Output Encoding**
   - Properly encode all output
   - Use appropriate content-type headers
   - Implement proper error responses

3. **Data Protection**
   - Don't log sensitive information
   - Properly handle sensitive data in memory
   - Implement proper data cleanup

4. **Testing**
   - Include security test cases
   - Test for common vulnerabilities
   - Implement proper mocking of sensitive operations

## Vulnerability Management

Our vulnerability management process includes:

1. Regular security assessments
2. Automated security scanning
3. Third-party security audits
4. Bug bounty program (coming soon)
